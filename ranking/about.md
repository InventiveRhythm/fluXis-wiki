### - Purifying (Ranking) your maps in fluXis

fluXis relies on a singular queue for your maps to be submitted to, once you submit your map to the Purifying queue, it will be sent to our Purifying team, who will proceed to review it and make sure there aren't any issues.

If a Purifier finds an issue in your map, they will post a comment on your map with either an Issue or Suggestion stamp.

Once your map is in a Purifiable state, the two Purifiers will go though each difficulty of your map and give a Purified Rating to it, Purified Rating determines how difficult your map is, it ranges from 0.00 - 30.00. 

If a Purifier determines your map has too many issues to be Purified, they will reject it for Purification, it will be removed from the queue and placed in a temporary suspension so you may not re-submit it, this temporary suspension lasts two weeks.
