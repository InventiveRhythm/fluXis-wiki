# Lighting
This is what decides what image shows up when hitting each column. This is labelled as `column-lighting.png`, and is applied to all columns regardless of gamemode.

It is possible to tint each column's lighting individually by following the `colours` command located in the [skin.json](/wiki/skinning/json) file.
