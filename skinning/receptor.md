# Receptor
These are the images that note where the columns are and where the judgement line should be at. The `down.png` images represent when the key is pressed, and the `up.png` images represent when the key is not pressed.

The files should be formatted as `{key}k-{lane}-{state}.png`. Lanes are numbered from left to right.

Examples:
- `1k-1-down.png`, `1k-1-up.png`
- `4k-1-down.png` -> `4k-4-down.png`, `4k-1-up.png` -> `4k-4-up.png`
- `5k-1-down.png` -> `5k-5-down.png`, `5k-1-up.png` -> `5k-5-up.png`
- `7k-1-down.png` -> `7k-7-down.png`, `7k-1-up.png` -> `7k-7-up.png`
