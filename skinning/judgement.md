# Judgement
These are the files that determine what image shows up for each of the judgements in-game. The files are labled as such:

|Filename|Judgement|
|---|---|
|`flawless.png`|Flawless Hit Judgement|
|`perfect.png`|Perfect Hit Judgement|
|`great.png`|Great Hit Judgement|
|`alright.png`|Alright Hit Judgement|
|`okay.png`|Okay Hit Judgement|
|`miss.png`|(should be self explanatory)|

The colour for the splashes can be changed via the `judgements` section located in the [skin.json](/wiki/skinning/json#judgement-colours) file.
