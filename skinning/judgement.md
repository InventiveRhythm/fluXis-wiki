# Judgement
These are the files that determine what image shows up for each of the judgements in-game. The files are labled as such:

|Filename|Judgement|
|---|---|
|`flawless.png`|Maximum Hit Judgement|
|`perfect.png`|300 Hit Judgement|
|`great.png`|200 Hit Judgement|
|`alright.png`|100 Hit Judgement|
|`okay.png`|50 Hit Judgement|
|`miss.png`|(should be self explanatory)|

The color for the splashes can be changed via [skin.json](/wiki/skinning/json#judgement-colours) commands
